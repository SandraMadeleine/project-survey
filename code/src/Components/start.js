      <p>Coffee, tea, or maybe something else? This survey aims to find
        out just what café visitors want to drink, and how often.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would be immensely happy if you would like to answer a few
        questions, the survey only takes about 2 minutes to complete. Thanks!
